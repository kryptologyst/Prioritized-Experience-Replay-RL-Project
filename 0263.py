# Project 263. Prioritized experience replay
# Description:
# In traditional experience replay, experiences are sampled uniformly at random. But in Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), we sample important transitions more frequently — those with higher TD-error — because they’re more informative to the agent’s learning.

# This leads to faster convergence and better performance. We’ll implement a basic proportional PER using TD-error as priority and sample based on it.

# 🧪 Python Implementation (Simple Prioritized Replay in Q-Learning):

import numpy as np
import random

# FrozenLake for simplicity

n_actions = env.action_space.n
 
# Q-table
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))

# ✅ What It Does:
# Implements a custom replay buffer that samples based on TD-error.

# Learns more efficiently by focusing on high-error, high-leverage experiences.

# Uses importance sampling to correct bias introduced by prioritization.

# Easy to integrate into DQN and other deep RL pipelines.
